2 I was hesitant to buy these socks with only 86% cotton listed, but I decided to try them anyway.When I received the socks they were 83% cotton and not as described in the listing.  I wore onepair of them one day and my feet have not sweat so much in I don't know how long.  Maybe I willsave them for next winter when the temperature is freezing.
2 It fit the window, but it arrived without one of the connectors.  I just duct taped it because I knew it would be covered by the curtains.  I didn't want to take the time to return because we were having company in and I needed the curtains up ASAP.
2 It works well but you need something like a fine tip permanent marker to write on it.  Luckily I have plenty of these.  I tear off a piece of the appropriate size, stick it to the counter, write on it, then peel it off and put it on the dry container lid.  Much better than using sticky notes which don't stick well in the freezer.
2 Melissa and Doug doesn't disappoint. Like, ever.I got this set for my 18 mo daughter who has wanted to play with fridge magnets that were within her reach. I thought it was a bit early for the letters/numbers situation, so I found these. She LOVES popping up to the fridge and finding different animals, making their sounds, and arranging them as she sees fit.The magnet covers the entire back of the animal so they stick easily and firmly, but aren't difficult for my kid to take off the fridge.And if you don't want to keep the barnyard on your fridge all the time, the wooden box they come in is great for storage!LOVE this set!
2 We are on our second of these printers.  The first one lasted four years and needed its drum replaced as well as other parts.  We discovered that the price of replacing those items was almost as high as purchasing a new printer, so we opted for the new printer.We use this printer for our small business which involves printing color front pages which show the completed the project so it was important to us to have a printer which could do the work well and stay true to tones.  We found that the Lexmark was the best option.  We don't use it heavily so we were disappointed when it work out after four years but it is still the best one available for our needs and price point.
2 The actual watch is very difficult to read because the minute hand is more dark silver than white like the listing.  it was very difficult for me to read the time as a result because there was nothing that stood out on the watch face. The luminous part of the hand is at the tip, and this did not help much. The quality seemed good, and I do have another type of momentum. I cannot really give more that 2 stars because the purpose of a watch is to clearly see the time, and I could not with this model. It is a very poor design and the hands should be much more pronounced.
2 We bought this dehydrator about 3 years ago. My wife uses it all the time and couldn't be happier with it. She has dehydrated all kinds of vegetables, cooked then dehydrated pinto beans (home made re-fried beans are now a snap), she even made some beef jerky. It works great, is well built, will last a long time. We think we made a smart investment when we got this machine. No complaints or regrets.
2 I used to buy and play with only brand-new balls.  Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them.  So, now I only use second hand Callaways.  Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That's how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.The contraptions works like this:  It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of "clicks" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.-It's not the best device:- It's hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.--It does work OK:- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge.- It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.----The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.I do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!
2 GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed.No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE.  The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable.  A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to "bounce off of."  This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare.The film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat.A more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten.
2 You will love this filter because it's so light, inexpensive, and effective at removing flash glare.  You may hate it because it tends to sag right when you're ready to use it.  There's no rigidity except for aluminum foil lining some of the interior.
2 Guys, just buy this. It will make your wife happy, make your child happy thus make your life easier and make you happy.
2 These crickets are great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins during times when they are unable to feed on flying insects due to inclement weather (temperatures below 40 degrees, excessive rain, wind or fog, periods of excessive heat and drought). Crickets are similar to grasshoppers which are a natural part of a Martin's diet.When the crickets arrive, place the box in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, open the box and separate numbers of them into multiple zip lock bags. This way you can take them out of the freezer one bag full at a time and allow them to thaw and reach room temperature for feeding to your Martins. When you open the shoebox size box you will find the crickets within several layers of cardboard egg crate material. The best and least messy way to remove the crickets is to lay several sheets of newspaper on a non-carpeted floor (if available) and shake the contents of the egg crate material and the box onto it. Then when you are done sorting and bagging the crickets you can simply fold up and discard of the newspaper and with it the cricket "debris" (food remains and feces).Martins must be trained to accept the crickets as food, so you need to wait until such time as they are unable to feed on flying insects and are hungry before attempting supplemental feeding for the first time. Then you can use a plastic spoon to flip crickets into the air for your Martins to "catch" by putting a cricket in the bowl of the spoon and holding the handle of the spoon with your dominant hand while using the index finger of your other hand to pull back on the top/tip of the bowl of the spoon slightly bending the spoon and flicking/flipping the cricket straight up and airborne near enough and within the Martins eyesight. If the Martins are perched on their housing, flip the crickets up near them so that they can see them. If they begin to fly keep flipping crickets when they are near and especially when they are flying lower to the ground. The first time I tried this the Martins had been suffering through a week of constantly cold, rainy weather in which no insects were moving. At first only two of my Martins flew to "catch" the crickets I sent airborne, but on the 3rd day of attempted supplemental feeding, the rest of the Martins were just so hungry that as they watched the two Martins that were flying and "catching" the crickets they eventually gave in to their hunger and joined in, too.If you plan on trying to feed Martins that are already too weak to fly you can try placing some crickets in their gourds or housing.Crickets, mealworms and pieces of cooked beef heart can be offered on raised feeding platforms, too. These platforms can be purchased from the Purple Martin Conservation Association (purplemartin.org) which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Purple Martins.If your Martins are already used to accepting crushed egg shells or [[ASIN:B00AOJOBSE crushed oyster shells]] from a platform, they will more quickly accept supplemental feeding from platforms. Martins readily eat egg shells and crushed oyster shells and also feed them to their young as a source of grit and calcium. Extra calcium is extremely important for female Martins to produce strong eggs, and also for growing babies. A Martin's normal diet has plenty of protein, but they must get calcium in other ways. They will collect pieces of clam shell, fish bones, mussels, and snail shells from nearby lakes, rivers, ponds and creeks on their own, but can conserve precious energy spent in search of them when provided crushed eggs shells or crushed oyster shells. Just remember that chicken egg shells must be rinsed in cold water and then baked in a 200 degree oven for 10 minutes to kill bacteria such as salmonella before crushing them.NOTE: Many Martin landlords feed their birds scrambled eggs and while this may be okay in a pinch to feed to adult birds in inclementweather when their normal diet of flying insects is not available, scrambled eggs have high fat content and should not be fed regularly. Scrambled eggs are also not recommended for nestlings. Long term use of scrambled eggs will cause loose stool/diarrhea due to the high fat content. Cooked beef heart can be offered as a substitute to or alongside of mealworms and crickets, but ONLY BEEF and not pork.Also, mealworms and crickets can be sprinkled with calcium (in the form of crushed and powdered Calcium 600mg w/D tablets) before feeding to Martins in order to give them the calcium they need in their diet.
2 This was so easy to make and made very good chili.  Made garlic bread on side.  Was a hit. Will purchase again.
2 If you can find my review of Zelda; Oracle of the Ages...you will find more of my experiences.The game is great.  I am not.  I am going to have to go to the Cheats you can find Online and figure out how to get anywhere in this game.  Not their fault.  The Game Boy Advance little compacts are the most beautifully designed pocket games ever made.  Their charge lasts a long time, and the entire unit lasts and lasts.  These little Warioland 4 and Zelda, and Castlevania cartridges are a joy to own.  If you still  have one, hang on to it.  You can still buy a charging unit for not too much $ and too many kids let their parents talk them into trading them for the next new thing.  The parents (too bad) did not apparently play them.  The children were too young to know their value.  I started playing Mario Pinball and Warioland 4 when I was 73.  At  75, besides being an active harpist and trumpet player in community bands....I still play these games.  They are exquisitely created and a joy to have!nancy morse
1 This is all I needed. I am tired of paying more money for simple products that do nothing special, that is why I bought from Stalion. Simple brand that costs decent and that does everything the product ought to. This battery has a good performance and good price, which makes it a good purchase I guess. I can say I am not regretting this purchase so far.
1 Now this is what I am talking about. I am happy and satisfied with this purchased.  I will be buying more of this.
1 What do the negative reviewers honestly expect from this product? From the moment I opened it, I knew that it was exactly what I had in mind. The content could be more substantial though. That's my only quip.
1 Exactly what I wanted. It's spacious inside and really don't take up much space on the door, fit neatly in place. Note to the manufacturer, please do a better finishing job at the corners. Made in America should be excellent...I will recommend this product.
1 We have the light charged, resting on counter in laundry room, ready for the next power failure. We like the handy feature of the light for certain jobs.
1 I used this right away. Dark circles run in the family. I think I look better! :) The product makes my eyes soft.
1 These chairs are very inexpensive but they look good, they are comfortable. Assembly wasn't too awful. For the price, i'd say these were a good deal..
1 After using lipogaine minox for a few months decided to give the shampoo a shot. Absolutely hate IT! MADE MY HAIR shed tremendously, and it smells awful.  I would advise to stay away!!! ALL REVIEWS on this shampoo seem FAKE.
1 I have been pounding it out pretty hard,thanks to this stuff.I would say,go buy this stuff and get your sex on !!!
1 I have to say, with all of the junky MacBook battery replacements out there, I had my hopes quite low when I decided to buy this instead of buying an OEM replacement one. After a good deal of research and review reading I finally made my mind and bought this Key Power's battery and to be honest, so far it has been great. It gave me about 3 hours of unplugged power after 1st charge and cycle, and has actually improved in the 2 weeks since I got it. I'm not sure how long it will last, but the 18 month warranty makes me feel comfortable. I'm glad that I took.
1 Every time I got a headache, I drink two of this Advil liqui gels. 1 liqui gel is not enough for me.. It's very effective though.. Gonna buy 1 box.. I get a lot of headaches these days..
1 I used to use a oscillating fan to help me sleep.  But when it's cold you don't want a fan circulating air in your room all night.  For some reason the noise this machine puts out is much more soothing than an electric fan.  Just turned off a little by the price but hey, tons of people have nothing but good things to say and I am backing them up!
1 This item is splendid! It fit the way I needed it to and holds my Galaxy S5 and there are no worries about it dropping out. Used it for running and it held up great!I have bought ones that were definitely more expensive that didn't work half as well or did not go on right. Terrific item!
1 Cheap but Not working, come with only few accessories, Power supply not working well. the inks is useless, Don't try to use the ink and the needles for real skin tattoo or got infection..
1 Pros:-maintains the standard Zippo design and distinctive "click" sound when opened.-very compact design, fits really nicely in my hand and pocket for easy carry.-black matte finish is quite gorgeous. I wanted something different from the typical chrome finish and am not disappointed! The black finish also holds up well to use and handling.Cons:-since the lighter is so small, you may find that the usage varies quite a lot from when it is full to empty on fuel. The flame can vary in height and intensity. Also, I notice the smell of unburned lighter fluid quite frequently. Refueling often becomes necessary.
1 Worked great although I needed to update some drivers on my PC running XP to see the card. But after four months it just died, cannot re-format. Never had it in any extreme conditions, lost all my data.
1 Defective, leaking.The inside hose is too small restricting water flow to about half of what I used to get from old hose. It took me a lot more time rinsing off the soap. Unless you have all the time and don't mind spending half an hour showering then don't get this hose. Save yourself the frustration.
1 Original Carrera is much better I think. it is a great composition - one that stands out. Impressive juice...this will not be duplicated, ever. One of the best mens fragrances, however I found the Original Carrera at www.Thefragrancefactory.comThey are a reputable site you can read about them in the Seattle Times athttp://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991125slug=2997567
1 Assembly was pretty easy, although the provided allen wrench couldn't turn all the way around, making it a bit tedious. The glass is pretty thin, which makes me wonder about it breaking in the future, and would probably look better frosted. Overall, decent value for the money.
1 a very useful glass i use every day in the kitchen. they are perfect for when you have some friends over and want to bring some cocktails or soda...
1 It's noisier than I would have preferred but it's not to a degree that I can't tolerate. Besides, the results are great and my kids always enjoy their snow cones.
1 XS pills work on so many levels, and I think that's due to the green coffee and tea extracts that are in them. My body has reacted really well, meaning I just feel energetic and chipper all of the time. And of course I've lost weight, too, almost 30 pounds in just under 2 months. All in all, I love everything about these. Would definitely buy again.
1 This works very well. I have pale fair skin and have puffy eyes with dark purple bags. I have to continue using products like this because I constantly get the bags. I discontinued use of the one I was on and did not use anything for a week. My bags were back. I started using this and you can see that it worked very fast, the puffiness was gone and the bags faded fast. They are even toned  soft
1 My scalp was allergic to most color brands, over the counter and at the best salons. This is the best colorant for me haven't had that problem since. My hair is so shiny, soft and it is a beautiful color.
1 I was shocked at the awful smell and the fact that I could not feel anything good about this product.  I used the whole bottle and it just seems to be a placebo that really does not work.I am switching back to my old resveratrol
1 I ordered two pairs. They got delivered much faster than the 4-6 weeks I was expecting. I think it was only 7-10 days. They are OK headphones
1 When I use a product, I don't want to settle with what is just good. It has to be mind-blowingly excellent. So far, this product has only been good.
1 Picked this up for my daughter, she does like the color.  Haven't taken her out fishing yet with it so we'll see how it does in actual use.  But so far seems pretty decent.
1 Super sharp, this cut my finger once becasue I was holding it wrong. Great item, not cheap at all, has a nice weight to it unlike the other plastic ones.
1 It is really great! I gave it to my wife and she is really happy. Thanks to this tool, I can never be bothered seeing my wife using her bare hands applying her Eyelashes extension.
1 I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these.
1 These smell bad and the nifty nose piece that attempts to keep the light out doesn't do so at all.  all I can say I like about it is the little ear bud holders in the strap I think that's cool.
1 This is the easiest way I've found so far to completely cut snacks out of your diet. Within two weeks I was able to stop everything. I'm still taking the pills though because I haven't lost any weight. We'll see how it goes.
1 I have this case a friend actually bought it for my galaxy s4. It protects the phone very well but the sound quality isn't that great when your talking to someone. you feel like you need to put it lauder or take the case off but at the same time if you want your phone to be safe you should get this cases.
1 What else is there to say... We have a newly installed vinyl floor in our kitchen and didn't want any indents or markings from our chairs. These are easy to install and keep my chairs sliding easily across my floor and leave no dents or marks on the surface.
1 A nice rapid charging case that is compact and does not add too much bulk. You will get about 2 full charges out of this case which will easily get you through 1.5 days of moderate to heavy usage. It works with iphone 6 4.7; model only not to be used with iphone 6 plus 5.5; model. Easy way to tell battery life by pressing metallic button on the bank once and pressing again to turn off to stop from wasting battery of the case.
1 Scratches like crazy and the sides discolored quickly. My main issue is that I have dropped my phone from 3-4 feet and the bottom side of my phone is dented. I can't believe it got dented through the case.
1 very good quality, as with all products from luminarc. I find the plain design interesting and more useful than having a highly decorated one. A good deal too as i bought them when teh were on sale.
1 These pillows tend to be comfortable, We have these currently intended for couple of weeks and so i don't believe it has been even a 30 days since i own these, they tend to be fine if you ask me. The stiffness is actually good however I can point out to people that it is a brand new wedge pillow and so i do not recognize how lengthy would in which stiffness would last.
1 The watch is good, and half a month to evaluate it.. Function is very full, then call, send and receive text messages, as long as the phone can receive messages including QQ micro channel, etc. can be pushed to the watch, but can not back. Note2, Android 4.3 perfect compatible! Beyond the expected watches and mobile phones can actually connected via the Internet, this just can't pick up the phone can send and receive text messages, push missed calls and all mobile phone to receive the news.
1 Love taking this product right before my workouts. I have noticed improvement in my strength and would recommend to anyone looking to lose weight.
1 I haven't activated it yet bit I did try to enter some info in it and i found it to be very fast and sooo sensitive. the only thing i question is how difficult it is for me to enter numbers...maybe i just have fat fingers.
1 The counter stool is great for the price, and the fact that it is available immediately is a big plus. Most stores we went to required a few weeks to prepare. The wood has a nice smooth polish to it, the stands are very stable, and they look great in our kitchen. However there is one drawback that I have noticed. After only 2 months of use, the cushion has started to basically wear out thin. Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes.
1 its a great read, facts to be read is just so shocking and the same time amazing, Love it, I just love it....
1 It's perfect size for purse or travel. It comes in a little spray pump bottle with a lid. It has no smell, oily, it dries quickly and it's sticky. I hate having to  wait for hand sanitizer to dry. Great for people on the go. Excellent shipping time.
1 I have friends and family who purchased nearly exactly the same spa and paid twice as much for it. I really did my homework and shopped around and you guys definitely had the best prices. I love this spa! It has all the features I was looking for and the quality is fantastic. Setup was easy breezy beautiful!
1 Great face mask of minerals from dead sea. Shipped with prime. It gives a burning/tingling sensation for a lil while when u apply, but the skin feels soft and fresh after. All natural cleanser and exfoliator. Came with an ebook which you can download online, havent looked at that much though.
1 Libro que parece haberse escrito bastante aprisa sin detenerse mucho a profundizar en los personajes. El escritor vuelve sobre el socorrido tema de Cuba, aunque no presenta nada novedoso. Los lectores no hallaran aqui algo que ya no se haya dicho antes en otras novelas.
1 L'Ete De Ventilo by Ventilo for women , Oh how I loved this fragrance!! No fragrance has ever given me more attention and compliments than thisI found my bottle At www.Thefragrancefactory.comThey are a reputable site you can read about them in the Seattle Times at http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991125slug=2997567otherwise 5 stars forsure on this fragrance
1 I took this and didn't feel very well afterward. It wasn't horrible, I just felt a little bit nauseous. I started reading some of the other reviews and began to be concerned. Should I be?
1 This chair is quite durable. I bought it for my daughter's room and she is happy with it. The seat and back are very fluffy and comfortable. The only thing I'm not happy about, is the color. I bought the blue since my daughter's bedroom walls are painted a very light blue, like the color shown online for this chair. If the chair color actually looked like the one in the online photo, it would be perfect. But it is a much darker blue than it is shown and I was very disappointed with that...
1 I recently began a new fitness program that put a pounding on my 55 year old joints. I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.
1 This is great for things like axes or other utility blades but you should forget about using this for your kitchen knives.
1 I can't iron fast on a blanket.Lucky that my mom gave me the old ironing board that she had before.It was not new but looks like it's not.Thanks to my gorgeous mom who gave this!
1 Great fun. I bought these for my kids, and they had a great time making designs on their own nails, and playing salon. The free refill offer is excellent. Nice product.
1 Great stuff.  This mud mask is not only fun to use but feels great.  It definitely made my pores look smaller and made my skin feel firmer.  It was easy to put on (for a mud mask) and felt fine while it was on.  I would recommend using it maybe once a week or so.  My grandkids thought it was hilarious too!!
1 To put in few simple words. If you like Buffett or if you want to learn more about him , then buy this book now :)
1 Ahhh!! Im so happy to have found just blue jolly ranchers.  Like someone else stated, there never seems to be enough blue in a bag of mixed flavors.  And all my friends fight over the blue ones. lol  I just wish the price wasn't as high as it is.  But ill pay it to have my blues
1 its not a bright blue as you would expect. Its a dark green rather..But still a nice color.Does get smudgy after a while..
1 This is so hard to do. But it works.If you want to look great you have to work at it. This program directs you how. And for that I will pay the price because it is a lot more cheap than hiring a trainer.
1 I like it to shower with. The fragrance does quickly disappear. The bottle is only nice for appearance. I really like the honey moisturizing. that's it that's all.
1 This clock is exactly what I was looking for and fits my space perfectly. Thus far it has kept great time and looks good over the mantle
1 I don't really know what I was expecting when we got this. I thought that at least my toy pooch wouldn't bark or growl as much for no reason. Throughout the time that we spent on trying this however, her barking didn't let up one bit. She still barks even when the neighbor's car slams at night.
1 Okay, on my part I would give it 4 stars reasoning being that its lid is not fine with those soft vegetables. However, with carrots, it's just as it has been illustrated in the photos which is what made me purchase it. That is a minor issue and wouldn't be fair not recommending it to anyone and they can be ready to make some salad which is delicious and quite appealing to the eyes
1 These are real than the screen, like my friend. Exquisite craft and realize the value of the funds is truly wonderful.
1 This is a unique concept compared to a lot of other teething products. There are plenty of really awesome necklaces that are baby safe for chewing and I utilize them a lot- [[ASIN:B00E7OXN22 Pendant Baby Teething Necklace - Non-Toxic Jewelry for Mom, Safe for Babies to Tug, Touch, and Chew! - Buy 1 Get 1 FREE!]]. It's a super convenient way to keep the teething toys with you at all times without worrying about them falling on the floor or getting thrown if you're out shopping etc.What makes this particular piece unique is that from a distance, you'd think it was actually jewelry. It's safe but it's multifaceted obviously so that makes it great for moms like me. Unless you're right on top of me you really can't tell it's beat up at all. It's great to know there's something I don't have to be embarrassed about if I forget to set it aside (we've all been there- puke on shirts...you know ladies) before we go out later or something along those lines.
1 Just built my friend a new office computer with this chip and very happy with the build. Chip runs cool and does everything that she needs including graphics editing and excel spreadsheets.
1 My dog won't take these. Dogs usually know when there is not good product. Is it really dasuquin in these tablets?
1 I like the unit and once running it does everything expected. However, it does not like to be hurried when first starting. You need to turn it on and leave it alone or it gets locked up. Gets very annoying when trying to watch a new movie. Once started however it works great.
1 This pressure oven does a superb job on roasting turkey and chicken. They come out moist and tasty in a short period of time.The feature doesn't work to well though. The rod becomes disconnected when the oven heats up under pressure and of cores it quits turning and even fell out once. If you cook without pressure it stays in place but takes longer and you loose the moistness.
1 Went for the price but no major regrets. The light has to be placed at the right place without too much obstruction/ objects around. Can cover only a small area, around half a tennis court. The cord is also a bit short. All complaints were made by my son, who used it for his indoor party. I on the other hand am very content with it for the purpose that I bought it for.
1 I really love this Gold Plated flatware. It is sooo beautiful. I do wish you would see if you can manufacture some matching ice tea spoons. Then the set would be perfect.
1 The design on this is a lot more prominent than I expected. And although it's very thick and sturdy, it's also light as a feather, which is great. I like how it doesn't look like your typical yoga mat bag.
1 The quality of this bathrobe does not nearly come close to what was advertised especially considering the high price. I can get one just as thick in any one of the inexpensive chain stores. I just touched the fabric and was very disappointed. Returned it without opening it at all.
1 To be honest I was a little dissappointed with this game. I bought it becuase the store had a good deal on it and I decided to give it a shot.  I think this game has some glitches that should have been worked out before release. But I haven't had some of the problems other reviewers here are saying is in the game. If these glitches were worked out I'd give it five stars. I just don't think it's as bad as some people are saying.
1 Had to send the first one back. The release mechanism was defective. No hassle returns policy, ordered the second one, but had to settle for another color...OK, the new one worked fine. Great size.
1 This product was weak and barley gave me the extra kick I was looking for to increase workout performance. This product may work well for people that are sensitive to stimulants or new to supplements.
1 What I particularly find useful is the topic on app security. The author really did a great job in explaining the engine behind external app authentication using OAuth and S2s high-trusts.
1 When the light turned on, it looks good! Unfortunately, the music does not work!One end of a two-lane, if you do not want the music to a separate, possibly during transport. If you happen I can not give five stars!
1 I was surprised at how big this toy is. The assembly took a little over an hour and the girls were helping as much as they could. They were very excited and have spent a lot of time playing with it with their barbies.
1 It's a nice case for the price. It is easy to slip on. It protects the phone by creating about a 2mm gap between the case and the phone. It also has about a 2mm lip over the front to protect the screen if you drop it. But I'm a little disappointed with the color cause it's slightly brighter pink than the picture shows. I was hoping for a peachy pink and it is a little brighter than that.
1 The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means."Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me..."The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.
1 I think this product works as described but it lasts not very long at all, maybe a couple hours of increased focus and alertness but that is it.  For the price I would expect this to last all day or at least most of the day. At this rate I would need to reorder a new bottle every 2 1/2 weeks.  I'm sorry but I can't afford to do that.
1 This is a toy not a medical product. It stopped working in just 1 day, the silly trumpets don't sound anymore. I'll just count it as money in trash. It's an absolutely useless product. No wonder it's priced at 30 bucks.
1 Good enough for the outdoors if it was right in front of you.  You hear the mosquitoes get zapped.  its disgusting cleaning it though.  I guess you could always get  a new one.
1 The lack of physical activity caused me to have cellulites on both my thighs and legs, I've done lots of exercise to get rid of them but none of them worked. I had told by a friend of mine that cellulite cream with retinol and caffeine will work and so I ordered this product, two weeks after using it on a regular basis and I have seen a significant improvement. This product is what I'm looking for!
1 good price, quality is okay, but for the price is good enough,will buy few more as gift for my friends
1 This is exactly what I was looking for. Prevented my phone from breaking after couple of drops also.
1 I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.
1 This is definitely worth the minimal time and effort. Just one pill a half hour before your meals and boom. You're losing weight and feeling better inside and out every day. At least thats the hope. For me it worked, I actually have a friend who bought them at the same time as me who hasnt had the results Ive had.. Not sure the deal but I can't be happier with what's happening with me.
1 We needed a second one (I have twin boys and they could share one when they were really young, but not anymore) and this one is a great buy for the money. All the features of Pack n Play - easy set-up, etc. for under my budget. You can hardly find one second-hand for that amount.
1 This bracelet is gorgeous, but I found it so uncomfortable. I don't have large wrists, but my wrist bones do kind of stick out. No matter were I placed the cuff, it was hitting my wrist bones. I had to return it.
1 I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha
1 I feel some stinging in my teeth every time I use this product. And I know it really works though, because I’ve seen my teeth get a lot whiter. Overall I’m happy with this, and have no major complaints.
1 I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance.
1 Once again, dealing with them was a pleasure. It is a handsome and functional wallet, well made from high-quality materials. I expect it to give years of good service.
1 Perhaps it's because I'm surrounded with a dense miasma of collective pop culture references all day, but I found The Goldfinch quite captivating. It's good to suspend the more intense inclinations of the mind and simply allow it to be submerged in the story. On the other hand, I can understand the disappointment that some might feel if they think that the quality did not meet their expectations.
1 Really like these candles. Gave 2 for gifts and kept one for myself. Elegant looking and works great. Enjoying the timer option and fact that I can put in a location you would never be able to put a real candle. Put inside TV stand and adds to decor.
1 The instruction page very easy to follow and understand. The fact this is waterproof is a major plus, as we do get rain and showers during the months my vegetable garden is planted and grown. I am just really happy that the squirrels and skunks don't beat me to my garden grown vegetables, and I would highly recommend this item.
1 I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.
1 The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits.
1 I decided to spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind of knowing this thing was going to work without hassle. Once again, ASUS didn't let me down. Put in my i7-3770k and everything started up with no problems.
1 I have wanted this watch for a long time now and finally made my purchase. I didn't like that you can't really see the LED outside in sunlight. It's OK when's the sun goes down or if you're in a nightclub. I won't return it because of the cheap price and it makes a good conversational piece.
1 Nice watch for my friend's kid. I received it on time and in an excellent condition. Kids like it. I would recommend this as a good item to gift someone especially kids.
1 i like how minimalist this stand is, it doesnt take up much space and it looks very classy as well. One thing i hate about it though is that its difficult to adjust the inclination, its because the stand its self doesnt hold especially when you have a glass table.
1 This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.
1 The unit worked fine initially. However from day 2 on the signal drops every 20 minutes. I have to power cycle either the transmitter or receiver to get the units synced up again.
0 I have had two of these cases and they are absolutely my favorite cases. I wanted to avoid a bulky Otter case and go with something a little more easy to fit in my hand or pocket and this case worked great AND protects my phone like a champ. I can't tell you how many times I have dropped my phone. My three previous iPhones and one android have lasted just long enough to get me to the upgrade mark. Usually I drop them and have to struggle with a cracked and broken phone for about six to eight months before I can replace it. However, this time, at my husband's insistence, I purchased a speck case. Not only has it protected my phone, but the case itself holds up for a very long time (and is easy to clean). My first case lasted me about eighteen months. Truth be told, I could have kept it on my phone and it would have kept doing its job, but it was starting to get a few cosmetic issues. My husband bought me my new case for Christmas and it is still going strong in July. I will never use another brand of phone case! It's the best!
0 I ordered this watch as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend and just got it in the mail.  I was a little worried about the quality because I had never heard of this brand before, but the watch looks great and the diamonds are "blingin".  I'm even considering giving it to him early so he can wear it to his company's holiday party next week.  I would definitely recommend Just Bling. Their service is great too.  I called the number off the website to ask about getting links taken off and the customer service rep was really nice and helpful.
0 Cute
0 I am just starting in wire wrapping and these stones were an inexpensive set to get me started at home.
0 This is a great price for this item and has a nice professional look once installed.
0 Ok not as thick as a garden hose, but very beefy wire. Great quality and sound. Highly recommend it
0 On days where I have consumed a few too many carbs, I have taken this product and I think that it helps.
0 This book is rambling, incoherent, repetitive,  intellectually dishonest and manipulative.  It presents a extreme, one-sided interpretation of the 1989 NCTM math standards as universally recognized, research-based  quot;best practice.quot;I would recommend that anyone choosing texts  for a math methods course use the 2000 NCTM standards themselves and, if  necessary, a generic teaching methods text.The 2000 Standards document  is economical, beautifully done and, most importantly, far closer to a  consensus of teachers, teacher educators, mathematicians and psychologists  on what constitutes best practice than the 1989 document which inspires  this text.
0 Cute cute cute! Doubles as a wallet so you won't need 2 items rattling around in your bag when you get to customs at the airport!
0 Came back from vacation and I received my waist shape wear couldn't wait to try it on. After looking around and ordering a few that was either to small or didn't fit right I finally found one that I can't take off. I wear  it to work and it is comfortable I just can wait to see my results in a few weeks.
0 First of all, I just started liking this type of music. I never listened to a punk/rock group no more than 2 months ago. At First I heard Good Charlotte's new cd (The Young and the Hopeless), and it really didn't click with me. But then my brother kept playing it and I fell in love with "Lifestyles of the rich and the famous". So i went out and bought that cd. And after that I heard they had a self-titled cd. I listened to my brothers copy, and the next day, I was out buying a copy for my own collection. The songs are extraordinarily written. Especially "Little Things", "Seasons", and "Thank You Mom". Good Charlotte really knows how to write powerful and touching lyrics. They could write an amazing sad and meaningful song, and then go and do a fun, upbeat happy song. Good Charlotte is excellent, and even though I just started listen to punk/rock, they are by far the best group I've heard. Go out and buy this cd, don't burn it, that's cheap. Give them a chance, you will love it.
0 Needed it to clear out old phone history as well as text history as it claimed it would. Phone history it works great on, text it doesn't even touch.
0 This is a great toy for baby. It's colorful, soft, and the music is soothing and relaxing. The size and shape is perfect for baby to hold and play with. It also will grow with your baby. From newborn and up, this toy is great for all ages!
0 For the general reader this translation by Macaulay is sometimes a little archaic. For example it sometimes uses "thee" and "thou" forms where just the modern "you" is quite sufficient. However to my surprise this translation was by far the most useful when I, as a student of the Classical Greek language, was translating directly from the Greek and wanting to understand a difficult passage. Of the half a dozen different translations I have, this one is certainly the most literal and closest to the Greek text.  Rather than this translation, I think for the general reader the "Landmark" Herodotus not only has a very modern, vibrant translation, but also has twenty articles about Herodotus that make it great value. However for the student of Greek this Kindle edition is terrific value and more than useful. It's saved me hours of frustration.
0 [[VIDEOID:5fb59c10ff5918cdec871eb3dea9c001]]Strikes, Punches and Kicks. This DVD consists strikes with your hands, elbow, head, punches with fist, and kicks. You will also learn where to hit (primary striking zones), how to strikes and different combinations (multiple strikes and kicks), including strikes to disarm a weapon, shocking strikes, immobilizing strikes etc. The DVD is an eye opener! It will give you a lot of ideas of developing new striking methods that you never thought about before. ~ Tommy Sættem
0 I chose 5 this product is great, I would recommend it, made a carton in no time., easy to use
0 I have owned a 46xbr3 for over a month now. I would 1st like to say that the image of this TV is awesome. The menu options you have to tweak the look of the image is very very detailed. It helps if you run component and HDMI signals and need to have different tweaked settings to optimize look and reduce pixelization. 1080p with your playstation 3, blu ray or hd dvd players. The tv does not run 1080p component, only hdmi and vga, so your xbox 360 will have to run in 1080i (still looks great). The xbox 360 does run 1080p through vga input on this tv but xbox360 makes the screen look washed out.Clouding Issue:There is however a manufacturing defect that is not officially published by sony and no recall is yet in effect. The Sony LCD flatpanels XBR2/XBR3 40"/46"/52" screens have a greater then 50% chance to have a defect nicknamed "clouding". I am one of those unlucky buyers. What "clouding" basically is, is white puffy looking background lighting, when screen is black. This is not to be confused with non uniform lighting often seen in PC lcd panels; This is much worse and much brighter and heavily blotchy. For most people with this problem (including myself) you can only see this clouding during times when the screen goes black. (credits at the end of the movies, transitions between commercials to tv shows, dark parts scenes in movies and shows.) During these dark scenes they stand out like a sore thumb and make viewing distracting; due to the fact they are very bright and whitish. My experience is the longer the TV stays turned on the brighter these clouds get. When you 1st turn on the Tv they are very faint.  They also have an odd habit of shifting around the panel very slowly over the course of weeks. (as strange as this may sound) I have found the clouding does not discolor or overbrighten the screen when the TV has full colorful images on it. This is why this problem is tolerable and I did not demand my money back, its still not acceptable though. I have read a few users say their clouding is so bad it effects the colors and makes them washed out. Thankfully I have not seen that.Please do not take my word for any of this I encourage you to be a critical thinker and go out on google and seek this "sony lcd clouding" issue. I am doing my part for the small community of us who are stuck with this sad problem overshadowing what is otherwise an absolutely great HDTV.In closing this TV is beautiful looking but when you spend this much money you don't want things like this bringing down your morale over the product. If you buy this TV you could be one of the lucky buyers and get an untainted screen and most stores give you a 30 day return policy. I have also heard (not confirmed) that the newest manufactured models have fixed this issue. I gave the product 5 stars despite the flaw, because even with this flaw I love this TV.Best of luck with your HDTV purchases. Hope this helps.ugh.

0 I thought I would try out some other brands for flavored liquid stevia. This one you have to add twice as much to barely taste something akin to chocolate. The flavor is fine, just very very weak.
0 I think it's a nice looking shoe.  However, it was a bit tight feeling in the toe. it is rare that size 9 isn't a fit for me, but If if if I reorder, I will go up a half size.
0 I was out of town when this arrived broken and the le creuset cast iron pot I ordered with it arrived with a chip on the lidNow it is too late to return these two damaged items
0 this works really well, got it so I have extra, total of 6 now and they works well, last a bit longer than the original Canon at 1/2 of the price!
0 Works as promised i received an email in about 10 minutes and used the code and works on my xbox one.
0 Install easy
0 Nice grouping of lights. It was an anniversary gift for my daughter and she and her hubby love them. They are heavy and well built. A good buy.
0 They are tube socks, and they are exactly what you think.
0 This item and two other items I bought, were too large going by the measurements provided.My dog- a small but thick-set pitX weighing about 45lbs, measures 18" neck, 24" +/- collar to tail. The XLs are waaay to big -I bought a tee, hoodie and fleece-lined hoodie and are all hanging way over his butt and too big around the middle so his wee doesn't clear the shirts.  In retrospect I should have gotten him the Large but going by the measurements I was afraid it would be too tight. I had to cut the belly area open on his old hoodie which doesn't look so great but solves the issue. I wasn't sure what size that one was as the tag is gone/faded, so I went by the numbers and got the XLs. They are so gapingly large he's likely to get entangled if he's sleeping in them- besides hanging off the rear, the opening at the neck also is larger so it allows for it to further slip back exacerbating the length problems. The prices have all gone up quite a bit since the pre-Christmas prices when I bought so it wasn't worth it for me to return and re-buy so I may try to make some alterations myself.  I came back to add a photo but there is no option to do that. It will let me change the text and add a video but no option to add a photo.
0 The wrong toy was sent to me and had to return it. The origional was no longer available so I had to order a cheaper one. It didn't have the lights, sounds. etc. I was disappointed. The price was almost as high as the origional one that I wanted. It was for my grandsonl
0 The construction of this mount is as good as any I have seen. I was shipped promptly. However when I received it I was disappointed to find that the wall I wanted to mount it on had 24" spaced studs. This unit is designed for 16" studs. Other than my mistake this is a great product and would have worked great for my 32" vizio!
0 I've been searching for a book that pushes the envelope and this one certainly does that.  Everyonethat sees it on my zentangling table picks it up over and over again.  I know three art gals that finallyordered copies of their own.  Its reasonably priced, and has a chest full of ideas to get one's creativejuices flowing!
0 Went on in about an hour even with no instructions. Made my bike a whole different ride
0 I didn't need to use this item for several months, and I was greatly distressed to discover it didn't turn on at all.  If anyone has any great ideas, I'd be glad to hear them.  It's too late to return it, but it absolutely won't work.  That's a lot of money for a lemon!!  I'm a little surprised that a Hoover would be such a failure.  I have another, older model, which works fine but which was difficult to haul up and down stairs.
0 Batteries work great
0 The seat was for my husband. He said it was flimsy not very sturdy. I had bought one before and he liked it. But this one wasn't made as well.
0 A M3 as other reviews state, but I'm cool with that.  great set of stand offs.
0 I have an otter box on my iPhone, maybe I read it worry, but it didn't fit. Waste of money
0 Very cute decals.  Will be adorable in my newest grandson's nursery.
0 It fits perfectly and the fabric is great for Arizona weather!
0 I really liked the contemporary pattern and color on this file folder. I was going to get the matching pads etc that are in this new colorful line but when I peeled the sticker that came on the front of it, 1/2 the ink came off with the sticker (and the sticker peeled off pretty easily!)  That said, while it looks nice now, I don't think the exterior colored part will last or hold up with use.
0 this game is so much fun! the only bad thing about it is that it sometimes lags. other than that this game is awesome.
0 I meant to give a 5 star rating before but hit the wrong spot.  I really like the massager. It' much quieter than other massagers I have used.  It' pretty powerful, but I have to agree with other reviews that there isn't much heat.  That isn't a big thing for me.  I would recommend the massager to friends.
0 Makita finish sander. Sander is supposed to be 1/4 sheet sander but I kept having to trim about 1/4 inch off the sand paper to get a tight fit on the sander pad. Problem was the pad was worn out. With the new base the paper fits perfect and is back to doing a great job. Well worth the money spent.P.S. the original pad was a rubber or foam composistion and the new one is a felt material. Works perfect
0 I only received one in the mail.
0 Very cute and does the job!
0 excellent service.....thank-you
0 Met my expectations
0 I have purchased five different CD's By Damaris Carbaugh and I beleive that this is the best showcase of the power and smoothness of her voice.  It is an older album than most of the others. All but one of the songs on this album is an original, non-standard Gospel title, so the songs are quot;newquot;. Each has excellent orchestra backup, and it is her style is to make the songs more complex by changing range of melody as it progresses. Damaris has a an unusually clear, smooth and somewhat lower pitch voice, which makes her music stand out.  Most of the selections are  upbeat and have a modern feel.  I really like this CD and have purchased several to give away to friends and relatives.
0 Exceptional Service, very good call quality! Easy to use with contacts, also can get better call quality if needed. Worked way better than Skype when we were traveling - sounded just like we were just around the corner!
0 The acting left much to be desired.  I think if the movie had better actors and maybe some parts of the movie taken out.....maybe it would be worth almost 2 hours of your life.  The way it is now......not wroth the time.
0 The boots are a great fit
0 I was impressed at how quickly this costume arrived, considering that it was custom tailored (I sent a whole diagram of measurements, like a tailor would use) and it had to ship from overseas. For the cost it is impressive that this suit is customized to my husband's exact measurements and fits him perfectly. Yes, the fabric is costume quality which is to be expected because it's a COSTUME! But I must say it's of a good quality for Halloween or stage. If you want a Hugo Boss suit, then you are going to have to pay big bucks for it. Overall I'm very happy with it. We are going to several Halloween parties this year as a couple's theme of Butler and French Maid.
0 THIS INK WILL NOT WORK IN MY NEW KODAK 7.1 HERO. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS INK AGAIN. WASTED MONEY AND TIME. FROM NOW ON I WILL STAY WITH THE KODAK BRAND
0 I am using this paired to a Surface Pro, so take that into consideration for context in the review to follow.The 'horseshoe' design rests fairly lightly on the neck.  It did take a little time to get used to - I found I was unconsciously 'hunching forward' a bit when first wearing it, but it is by no means uncomfortable...just different.  The way the cords are attached with a movable loop, and the provided rubber earpiece covers in different sizes should provide sufficient sizing  options for most users.  I'm fairly bull-necked and I don't feel the cords 'pulling' the earbuds from my ears at all, even when turning my head.The battery took a fair amount of time to take an initial full charge, but after that it seems to last quite a while.  Even after playing a game on my Surface for a 3 hr planeflight, it still said ;battery high; the next time I turned it on.  There's a small lighted indicator for the battery charging that goes from red to blue when it hits full.Verbal feedback is great.  ;Connected....battery high;.  Audio feedback with beeps of ascending or descending scale when changing volume level.  The buttons are findable with your fingers only when wearing to raise/lower volume, and presumably the answer call button although I'm not using as a phone function.Sound is fairly good - I don't really notice much background hiss, and both music and game audio seems full range.  I actually find I have to have these set at near minimum volume to be comfortable with it, even in high ambient noise situations (airplane), so it's got plenty of oomph.If I have any complaints at all, I wish it had a little more visible ;left; and ;right; indications, vs. the rather tiny molded letters in a box.  I guess in time I'll get used to the fact that I want the volume up/down buttons on the left side.  Then again, the volume plus or minus indicator vs. the track up track down indicators molded into the buttons are also very small, and don't provide any tactile distinction between them, so its not easy to tell whether you've put them on backwards.  That's one reason for a one star deduction.  The other reason for a slight deduction is I do wish the magnets that hold the ear buds in place when not inserted in the ear were a little stronger, like other reviewers have commented.  They do stay in place when the device is just cuffed around your neck, but tend to wander when tossed in a pocket of my computer or camera bag, so I'm always sort of semi-untangling them (and then squinting at them to figure out left vs right) before I can put them on.Sound does get a little choppy when using this on a Surface with a Bluetooth mouse also enabled.  But that may be the Surface's fault in terms of the available stack bandwidth and prioritization.  Not taking a star off for that.Supplied USB cord for charging is fine.  I don't have any complaints about range since I use them while at the laptop (Surface) not wandering around a football field and expecting them to still connect.Overall quite pleased.  Good sound isolation from background, plenty of volume, audio range is acceptable for music (not audiophile quality by any means - what wireless headphones are? - and besides I'm 40+ so my hearing itself is probably damaged at the high end).  Perfect companions for a lightweight laptop or tablet with Bluetooth.  Just need a little more visual indication and/or tactile differentiation between left and right side buttons (simplest idea but not everyone would like it - just make the whole right side of red plastic and the left side of white or black plastic...).  Will I buy again if I lost them: yes.ded into the buttons are also very small, and don't provide any tactile distinction between them, so its not easy to tell whether you've put them on backwards.

Just need a little more visual indication and/or tactile differentiation between left and right side buttons (simplest idea but not everyone would like it - just make the whole right side of red plastic and the left side of white or black plastic...).  Will I buy again if I lost them: yes.
0 I purchased this battery to replace one that was at least 6 yrs old that came in the phone.  That phone would start beeping and go dead within 5 minutes of taking it off the base.  Now with this battery fully charged I have left the phone off the base all night and still no beeping and works just fine.
0 Really like it, it is quiet but still has a lot of power
0 Solid construction. Right earbud sounded great.Unfortunately, my set arrived defective. The left earbud only functioned when the cord was held in a very specific angle, implying that the wire within the cord was broken.
0 Hate ankle carry, but this item does what it is supposed to.
0 of your child´s life<BR>FOREVER!<BR>He will still have them..BUT NEVER AGAIN PANICA blessed talented book for kids!
0 Great product at a great price!
0 well, when your sold on a product from there literature and it fails you feel like a dope. there customer service told me they had problems with that unit and since the warranty period had expired they could offer no assistance at all.  not even a offer to compensate any discount.  so I think if your looking for a fan for your coach you should look at fantastic fan, got one of those in the rig also and it didn't quite on me.    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027H7L10/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
0 I like the score booth because i like to keep hitting stats also and not just pitch counts like some score books because i keep softball stats more then just baseball stats.
0 Item was delivered as it was described
0 I make lunches for my three kids every day and I was so tired of buying and throwing away juice boxes.  These are great.  They are fairly easy to clean, I can put milk, juice, or water that I know is healthy in them, they don't leak when closed, and I'm not adding to landfills.  If you plan to use these a lot, buying a box of replacement straws is a good idea because it's almost impossible to any others that will fit around the spout correctly.
0 Perfect, just what I wanted
0 These were exactly as pictured and their price was the best I've found on Amazon.
0 Even though it SAYS it will work with Windows, it does not.  Windows will not recognize this device (or apparently any bluetooth device).
0 We needed these for my daughter's play and they arrived on time. They looked precious in pictures. She wore them once or twice after and one of the bows fell off. She has a hole in the other. Not very durable for an active child. They are ok just don't expect long term use.
0 Beautiful!  My daughter was very excited to receive this.
0 I will make the better determination after I use it... I have so many things going on that I dont sit at the kindle every day so I will give a better rating once I figure it out
0 These boots fits perfectly. They are so cute and it looks way better up front than in the picture. Two thumbs up. I will be coming back for more in other colors.
0 Let me start this review stating that USUALLY, I do not agree with the movie nominationis for the Oscar awards.  If you usually do, then don't waste your time reading this.  I decide whether or not I like a movie with a couple of different criteria.  First of all, did it entertain me?  I like to be entertained by a movie.  Second, did it make me laugh, cry, or some other emotion?  I like a movie that elicits emotion from me.  I liked Top Gun when it first came out because I had a boyfriend in the navy at the time who was an air traffic controller on an aircraft carrier.  I watched it whenever I needed to feel close to him.  He liked the movie as well.  Top Gun entertained me.  I have watched it well over 200 times in the last 20 some odd years. I have worn out a VHS and one DVD.  The movie just made me feel alive and feel good.  I like it when a movie does this for me.  Call me crazy, but if I'm going to pay for a movie, I don't require absolute reality.  In fact, a little escape without the use of mind altering substances, is a pretty good thing.
0 Use this product and love it
0 This charger works fine and gives you a choice of plugging it into a socket or using a USB cable.
0 very satisfied
0 WORKS LIKE THE ORIGINAL BATTERY, HAD TO REPLACE ORIGINAL APPLE IPHONE 5S BATTERY AFTER WASHING PHONE IN WASHING MACHINE, AFTER DRYING OUT THE PHONE AND REPEATED ITUNES REBOOT OF SOFTWARE I REPLACED THE SHORTED OUT BATTERY AND THE PHONE WORKS LIKE NOTHING EVER HAPPENED
0 love the photos and the guys
0 when mine came one of the fans wires came unattached to the circuitry so only one fan would power on. i tried stripping it down to connect it but the wire itself was just barely long enough the way it is. so i messed with it for probably an hour before i finally trashed it.
0 Love it! Probably as thin of a case you can get without compromising protection. Also very easy to take off (unlike otterbox). There is nothing I don't like about it.
0 I love jazz. This is a different. It has an upbeat Latin tempo and I like it.
0 Excellent late 80's documentary that frighteningly explains why Hitler and the Nazi's lost WWII.  Weel put together and to the point.  What was really great about this documentary were the interviews with people who actually fought in the defining battles and one German national hero (Galland) who sat right next to Hitler and told him what he needed to do to win the war, but refused.  One thing I came away with after watching this is how thoroughly patriotic, brainwashed, loyal these Germans were to winning the war, in spite of the terrible atrocities being committed.  You can almost sympathize with them about why they followed and obeyed Hitler, and serves as a warning (IMHO) to us, AMERICANS, that we do not follow in the same path, should a Hitler-esque type politician arise in the future here.  THANK YOU David Hoffman, Norman Rose, and Robert Denny, for this great doc.
0 This diaper has been a favorite for my baby. I have purchased this diaper since newborn. And I will continue to use this until my baby will be potty trained.
0 No matter how tight or how often you "tune" it...it just undoes and does not make much sound at all. Kind of sharp on the back of the knots as well.
0 Single shot BB gun. Good design but durability is questionable.
