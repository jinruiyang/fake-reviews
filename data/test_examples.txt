2 [[VIDEOID:e69353dba5885c9c0230bbd179014b6f]]This us a clip light with 4 settings, the light it produces is not very bright.  I used a lux meter to help demonstrate the brightness of the light:    white light / bright setting = 344 lux  white light / low light setting = 162 lux    warm light / bright setting = 104 lux  warm light / low light setting = 66 lux    For comparison,  a 60 watt fluorescent light at the same distance is 1701 lux    The clip of this light is quite large, it is not something you would clip to the book as it would cover too much of the page. I found the clip a little stiff stiff and difficult to open, hopefully it will get easier as I use it.  I am using it clipped to a shelf.  My favorite feature is a nice switch on the cord that allows me to control the four light modes.  The neck is flexible and holds its position well.  It comes with a cord and USB adapter.    This clip light is provided by Mudder.    Ali Julia review
2 The cord is the perfect length for us. We got this to control the lights on our staircase. The plug is behind a couch and the power strip on/off switch was hard to reach. This saved many back aches. The manufacturer's description is wrong. It states that the switch is lit. It is not. not a deal breaker for us! glad we have it!
2 This is a very durable milk storage bag with easy top access. We use these bags when our milk bottles are full.It is easier to store than the bottles, though it meant having to pour it from the Medela bottle which my wife pumps directly into. The top of the bag is quite large so there is little spillage, and we store it in standing position.My wife usually breast feeds my girl so storage is not an issue though we feel that if you need to store more milk say in a freezer load, then these AVENT milk storage bags may not be as suitable due to its fairly large and bulky form.
2 The good is that this pairs easily with most bt devices, and as a speakerphone it's quite adequate. It looks pretty nice, though this leads to...The not so good is that though this looks iSleek, that emphasis on looks over functionality made them stick the pause button for receiving calls on the back of the speaker. Since it's slanted, this is just silly in every way. Other negatives are that while this sounds ok for voice, for music it's merely fair, and that it's not the heavy duty construction you'd expect at this price.It's a decent little speaker-phone/speaker combo, but 50 is too much for this somewhat flimsy piece of plastic, however shiny. 25 to 30 is what this is really worth, I'd say. And that button on the back must give one pause, as it were, as to whether that feature will make the speakerphone aspect worth pursuing.Amazing how designers just don't really think things through, or place form over function so often.In a world of cheap disposable crap, that crap should at least make perfect sense while it does indeed work.Bluetooth is still a selling point so companies are getting away with overpricing simple bt items. That can't last, nor should it.
2 This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler.
2 Sara Shepard does it again. Seriously, I'm in love with this series too.If you like PLL, you're most likely going to be a fan of this series as well. SS is able to keep you guessing the whole time, and by the end of the book you only want more. I stumbled across this entirely by accident, and now I'm reading my way through the series. I won't post any spoilers, but it's different...yet the same as PLL. You're going to want to know who did it, but you won't be able to figure it out. The clues will keep you guessing, and the plot twists will make your heart race. You'll love some of the characters, then hate them... and then love them again. It's awesomely fun to read, and I can't wait to get the next one!
2 I've never lost a pick since using this necklace. Well, at least after I got in the habit of putting it back in the necklace once I'm done with it. :) Holds two picks. I use the front one for looks, and the backside for playing.
2 Seen these used for years on Heavy Equipment (dozers and such).  Never had an issue with a Baldwin.  They are right up there with Wix.  I like how much thicker the metal housing is compared to most others.I'm running this one on my 2006 Duramax.  May shop for a larger filter next time though as there sure is plenty of room up there for more filter.Almost $13 from Amazon.  That's about $3 more than they were and than I like.
2 I bought this for my Coleman air pump and it worked well.  Only time will tell how long it lasts me.
2 So far it has worked as well as the original at a fraction of the cost (have not used the camera much, but it has been like 3 months of light use) I've changed the batteries 3 or 4 times in that time, the original battery life is not very good overall (but that's the camera), I knew that before buying it, I give it 5 stars because obviously I wasn't expected that the knock off would be better than the original, it seems to me as good as...which is all it is supposed to do, so I'm very happy.
2 The Actiontec GT701D Ethernet DSL Modem with Routing Capabilities didn't work out. The software indicated that it installed correctly but shortly after installation, I received a message from AT  T noting that there was something wrong with the Actiontec GT701D Ethernet DSL Modem and that they didn't support it! The Actiontec modem was really slow and after 15 minutes finally stopped! I re-installed my old SIEMENS SPEEDSTREAM 4100 and got back on the internet! I returned the Actiontec to AMAZON.COM who credited my account.
2 For $5.81 this four piece - 2 1/4; herb pollen grinder is fairly well made.  The Aluminum is machined well and it looks good.  I do have a little trouble getting the threaded pieces to start threading again after taking it apart and this could be better in another unit than mine. Stainless steel or Brass would be a better material than Aluminum.  It does have a pretty powerful NeodymiumMagnets for the inner piece, which allows it to come apart to load the grinder. It has diamond shaped teeth for grinding and aStainless Steel Pollen Screen and an Nylon ;O; ring for whatever purpose it serves, I am not sure.  I like it, but I don't have the herb to grind.
2 These cloths are terry, with the contrast striped hard woven.  They work well for cleaning lightly soiled dishes, washing counters and stove tops.  I bleach my counters a couple of times per day, at the end of the day, because they're white, and while cooking, after opening a package of meat, to avoid cross-contamination.  Thus, I have to be careful to only use the white cloths on the counters, since the bleach discolors the black cloths.  Other than that (and that's due to my idiosyncracy), these cloths are good and durable.
2 I've got a thirteen year old Rottweiler and he's actually pretty picky about his bones. He took to these right away. He devours them. He's happy with them so I am too.
2 My wife and I found that this product worked. It is wonderful for all skin types, and especially for mature facial skin, both for women and men.When we applied the serum to our faces, we found that when we placed just a few drops, the serum instantly absorbed into our skin and our faces felt very smooth and relaxed. Since only a few drops are needed, the 15 ml solution goes a long way.Because of the special formula of Pure Swiss serum it accelerates the skin self-repairing process. It gave us back our facial skin elasticity and youthful tone and look. We are told that this product is very safe for everyone, and only natural ingredients were used. It was not tested on animals.
2 I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author.
2 I bought six of these plus an EV ZXA1 powered subwoofer and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. They've been used as a monitor rig for my much larger QSC KW system and also as a mini rig for small clubs where the speakers filled both main and monitor roles. The inboard DSP works really well to smooth out the peaks and clipping and it allows for perfect Xover free matching of subs and tops. I used a pair of these tops with a pair of QSC KW 181 subwoofers and it worked in that configuration as well. They are not exceptionally loud, but they will do small rooms pretty well and have no problem working as floor monitors. Along with one of the ZXA1 powered subwoofers I was able to fit six of these and a 12 channel mixer in a tiny Toyota Corolla for a gig at VA Beach. I even brought lights and stands and it all fit in there with no problems. I surprised some veteran musicians who at first judged my mini rig as underpowered from the looks alone, when I turned up the kick drum during soundcheck to reveal that this full range system does not lack low frequency extension (in fact the sub provided the kick drum thump we all know and love!). It really is a good sounding system that gives the venerable QSC K12 a run for the money. I hope to get many miles out of these speakers.
2 I was so excited to find this projector. I've been wanting to do outdoor movies with my neighbors and this is perfect! It's so easy to setup, I can easily have an outdoor movie setup and ready to go in less than 1/2 an hour. Here's my take on this projector:    INSTALLATION  Installation is super easy. Just plug in the power cord and your video device cable. There are three different ways to connect this projector to your video device (HDMI, RCA, component).  The easiest and best is HDMI. There are no cables included, so I had to go out and buy and HDMI 25 foot cable and got what I wanted. This allows me to run it from either my cable box or computer super easy and the projector can be further away than just the standard short length HDMI included with my TV. With the HDMI it's a simple plug that includes both video and audio. You could run 2 HDMI cables since there's two ports in the back of the projector. I was able to hook this up with my Comcast Xfinity cable box super quick and had TV projected in my living room super-quick. Installation couldn't be easier!    DISPLAY QUALITY  Display quality is amazing!!! It is crisp, bright, and clear. It even displays beautifully in the daylight. I was totally amazed at how great the picture quality is. The color and clarity looks just like a regular flat-screen TV.    SOUND  There are built-in speakers and they're perfect for my needs. If you want to add external speakers you can, but totally not necessary for my outdoor use with small groups of people. The sound is very crisp and clear.    3D GLASSES  This couldn't be easier. I was able to try 3D using my Comcast Xfinity tripleplay 3D channel. It is included with my standard service, I just had to contact Comcast for them to "enter the code" so I could access channel 897. I charged the glasses before use for a couple hours and watched 3D for a little over an hour with no reduction in the battery power. All you do is turn on the power on the glasses, then hit the pairing button on the glasses and it paired right away with the projector with no problems. The 3D quality was great! Comcast has on demand 3D movies, so I can't wait to take advantage of that service since I don't have a 3D blueray player (although I'm considering getting one now). You must have a 3D player if you want to watch your own 3D movies.    PROJECTOR SCREENS  I wanted a portable screen and I finally found one at Fry's in Wilsonville, Oregon manufactured by Loch. [[ASIN:B00DV1INFY LOCH 84" diagonal 4:3 Tripod Projection Screen]] I tried Best Buy and was disappointed that they didn't have any screens "in store", the guy just wanted to sell me one from their on-line store. I didn't want to buy it on-line because the shipping is so expensive and I wanted to see the quality of the screen before I made the purchase. Fry's has the Loch screen in 100" and 83". I went with the 83" model and it is perfect for indoor and outdoor use. 100" [[ASIN:B00HK23QJI Matte White 100" diagonal Portable Projector Screen]] was too big for my little, tiny living room. I also considered the Epson portable screen [[ASIN:B000HRYV38 Epson Duet 80-Inch Dual Aspect Ratio Projection Screen]]. You can also project on the wall...I did in my computer room and it was so cool....read on...    COMPUTER HOOKUP  Just like the cable box, it was super easy to connect to my HP Envy laptop through the HDMI cable. The only problem I had was I had previously put it in 3D mode and didn't realize I had to take it out of 3D even after unplugging the projector. I can surf the web, watch YouTube videos, and show my huge library of photos on my wall. Even work on Word and Excel documents in super-large format...this is like having a HUGE COMPUTER MONITOR.    TECHNICAL SUPPORT  I had to call Epson tech support when I couldn't get my laptop display to show up. It's funny, their tech support looks like you're calling Long Beach California, but the tech support is actually routed through the Philippines. The technician spoke very good english, was courteous, and helpful.    SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION  It is fairly large (measuring approximately 15 x 12 x 6 inches) but worth the extra size over the tiny portable units since the quality is extraordinary! It has a big remote (measuring approximately 2.25 x 8.5 x 1 inch) with lots of buttons. What I really like is the remote has a "light" button that illuminates the buttons, so it's super easy to see and use.    OVERALL  Overall, I love this projector. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with this product!
2 Pterostilbene is a form of resveratrol that is recognized for its anti-aging, anti-inflammatory and cardio health properties.  It is believed to sharpen cognition.I had read about this and heard about it and have been delighted with it.  Jarrow products as a rule tend to be quite good and very beneficial.  They are gluten, soy and dairy free and contain no substances that are considered allergens such as fish and shellfish and nuts of any form.  It also boosts metabolism.
2 just like the expensive ones from David's bridal... does the job. it's breathable, not waterproof, so keep that in mind. if you want to preserve something important like a wedding dress, get it done professionally. Yes, it cost couple hundred $$$, but if you want to save it for your daughter or somebody else down the road... it will prevent it from yellowing.
1 a mix up in the positive/negative wiring. There is a small removable panel on the back of the solar panel and the charge controller, both easily accessible and requiring no tools, where one can simply verify that the wires are consistently connected from the positive terminal solar panel to the positive terminal controller to the positive terminal device being charged.
1 These brushes are too soft and very soon after your first usage you will see some of the bristles coming out. This is not worth the purchase, not falling for any generic product again.
1 Galore for women is very nice indeed. I have been wearing this for years and recieve many compliments when I wear this. I just found the Original Monteil Body Lotions for this wonderful fragrance at www.Thefragrancefactory.comThey are a reputable site you can read about them in the Seattle Times at http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19991125slug=2997567
1 This facial brush was great the first few months. I was very happy with it. Then every once in awhile during use it would shut off. Now when I use it, it is on for about 3 seconds, then shuts itself off and from then on it's constantly shutting itself off and I have to turn it on, again and again and again.
1 just bought this and wasn't expecting too much. I wanted to have laughter skin but I am not expecting to get it from this lotion, i just like the smell of this and the skin benefits. I don't know if I already got a noticeable lighter skin with this lotion, I don't notice much because I am not so focused on checking skin changes. But overall, this is really a good lotion.
1 I found that this eye cream irritated my eyes slightly. I think it's because it's currently winter where I live, and the climate is very cold and dry, making my eyes extra sensitive and my skin much dryer that normal. I think that caffeine in this product irritated my already sensitive eyes a bit. I normally don't have any issues with Passport to Organics products, and I have found the Zinc Eye Cream to be wonderful and very moisturizing for the winter. I look forward to giving Caffeine Eye Cream another try in the summer when my eyes are less sensitive!
1 The instructions were ok, but I was lucky it went together correctly since the instructions do not label back and front of pieces. The multiple screws and parts are not labeled on the packages which also is a problem.Once it came together it looked great. One draw was damaged and they are sending a replacement.
1 Needed this for a project and now the project has been scrapped because this did not perform as I needed it to. What a waste of time.
1 I always cook spaghetti.This grater works the best on grating the cheese that I place on top of spaghetti.The cheese are grated just right!It is also easy to clean!
1 As I was putting this together, I found areas where the laminate was coming off, the pressed board underneath it was falling apart and the screws were too small for the holes given.
1 Have to get used to since eggs are thicker than regular frying, but they look pretty and doesn't look scrambled.
1 Pillows were bought for me and my husband. Had to buy for grand-daughter and mother as well, so they would leave ours alone.
1 My wife bought this for the celebration of my birthday party. The guests really enjoyed it while having a conversation with each other. After the party is over, it's cleaning time! The dishwasher helped burden our task. This is a must-have for every party!
1 It made me scared to even try it.  Label was half torn off and syrup leaking every where.  Label looks like the picture like someone printed it off their printer at home, barely stuck it on a bottle and sent it out.
1 The new spigen nexus 5 ultra hybrid case is a nice durable case. I like how I can change up the design of the case whenever I want. It's super easy too. The case is not too flimsy. I took off one star became I feel like the back plastic can easily get scratched. But we'll see about that. I've only had for two days so we'll see.
1 Very interesting material but not a book that really grabbed me. Perhaps its because its not the usual kind of book I read.
1 This is the great product.Its collar is really awesome. It is made of high quality of materials with great price. So really I loved it. The case is also dirt and shockproof.So I am confident that my iPad is more protected now. A very fantastic all-in-one case that I recommend to everyone.
1 the item is very poor i used it twice it has no effect at all its simply useless ,and the other thing i need a spray as its mentioned .....but it was not a spray its a liquid gel and its
1 I was somewhat disappointed. The bag was not as thick or as padded as I would have liked. It serves the purpose, but lacks some useful features. More padding and more pockets or dividers would have been appreciated. Still, it is a good price and gets the job done.
1 I'm not sure these do much. I'm pretty sure they don't hurt anything, and it's possible my appetite was suppressed a little bit, but did not notice much of a difference in energy or weight loss. Might be better combined with other supplements for best results.
1 Excellent quality and versatile product. You don't have to think twice about it. More vibrant in person.
1 I really like the look of this box. My apartment is really small and I am looking for a neat way to keep things under my bed so that it stays out of the way and I can retrieve it when necessary. My concern is that I am not sure how tall this box is and I only have about 5 inches under my bed. I don't know why this product doesn't mention the height...
1 Nice wood blocks, but smaller than I thought they would be. My Son loves to stack  build with them tho.
1 The scent is amazing if you use just the right amount. The only problem is that for it to last all day when I'm at work I have to really spray a lot of it on and it's too much for a couple of hours but after I get to work the scent will taper off.I work in an office environment and the first day I wore it like 100 people asked me about it which is nice, but I could tell it was strong. I guess other brands are kind of the same but I think this one is like that because of the way its made and the scent even though it is amazing!
1 Worth the extra few bucks because it's really good quality. The cutouts are neat and the case fits the S4 well. I only wish it came with a screen protector.
1 The parts anchoring the handles broke the first time I use this bucket and now I'm looking at something that I wouldn't trust to clean anything with. Next time, I'm spending a little more on a bucket that can give me better service.
1 What a wonderful book. Sensitively written about a very sad topic. Yet the author succeeded in not making the book sad, but a wonderful depiction of a family's grief and growth. I can't believe I waited so long to read this. I will definitely read it again.
1 I really enjoy this camera, I take it where ever I go, it takes great pictures. And I make all my videos for my business with it. The only problem I just began to have is the battery life is not lasting like it did at the beginning, so what I am doing is constantly changing the brand of batteries to use.
1 Seems to perform just ok, it's a battery. Came packed well, easy to put in my Note 3, doesn't look used..it's a smidge more than batteries that say their OEM, but besides the label, there doesn't seem to be a difference.
1 I always wanted dreads and this IS the thing you might wanna use to get them. Really easy to use, just apply your regular hair gel on the sponge and just twist em away! Really easy to use and works beautifully. Getting dreads have never been easier. I really do recommend this!
1 I saw Exposed in Boston, face out, at The Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge. Vibrant front cover, interesting premise on back cover. An unusual cast of characters, a little over the top, which is why I liked it as much as I did. A really fun read.
1 This organizer works great in an office setting or at home. The organizer is durable, not too heavy, and can be used standing upright or laying on its side.
1 Easy to put on, yes. But it's really hard to take it off once you're done with painting whatever it is that you were painting. Also, this taped doesn't stick well into uneven surfaces and especially wood.
1 SMells really bad! Almost like rancid and old underwear.Do not purchase this. I can't tell if it is good on my skin or not because I can't bear the smell to even use it.
1 I bought one of these a while back and even got one more for my oldest son. Really handy to have when you want to mix up a quick fix instead of stopping for fast food. Mine discolored a bit inside but that's more cosmetic than anything.
1 I knew these wouldnt be that great but I didnt think they would be THIS bad! they feel SO cheap, are WAY heavier than they should be, lost both tips the first time out, the compasses dont work and the locking mechanisms dont stay lock so you have to keep tightening them throughout your hike. What a waste.
1 Using this product could not be easier in keeping our pool clean, which is particularly important since my grandkids often come over during summer.
1 I will not buy Viva labs again. They offer to donate $10 to a charity to leave a review. WHAT???How does that create honest product reviews??? How do we know they actually do that? That is just sketch. Any company that did this, I just had to look further into. Check out their Krill Oil product reviews, other customers had similar complaints about fake reviews.SO LOOK AT ALL FAKE THE 5-STAR REVIEWS! Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it. The easy answer is the reviews for charity donation bribe.Started to look into the company. Another reviewer pointed out that they were a Kentucky corporation but were foreign owned. It is easy enough to do a google search, so I did one but I did not find a facility. I only saw the generic office park. This is some sort of shell company or something? Even more strange. Where is their location at? Where do they make this stuff and where does it come from?Too many weird occurances for me to put it into my body.
1 The author of "Hell" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.In "How to Stop Believing in Hell" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.
0 I've been dealing with a sulfur odor from my relatively new water well, as well as an off taste first thing in the morning.  Alas, my previous (shallow) well offered fantastic water, but when it died, I was forced to comply with current health codes which require deeper drilling.  Water quality went downhill.      I thought I was stuck with inferior water until I read the May 2011 issue of "Consumer Reports," which assigned its top rating to the Clear20 CWS100A carafe filter - even higher than the Brita Smart Pitcher. At the remarkably inexpensive Amazon price (CR's price info was $24), I had to give it a try.      The carafe is easy to fill and I am extremely pleased to report that the filtered water is very good.  No sulfur smell; no off taste; just crystal clear pleasant tasting water.  Not as fantastic as my original well water, but very good.    Am so impressed am ordering a second carafe.
0 Giant thumbscrews are too large, and interfere with the mounting of my sight.  I literally cannot use this thing.  It was shipped quickly though.I'm not going to spend the time or money involved with trying to return a $15.00 unit, so it looks like I'm out.  Bummer.
0 Love my beautiful pendant!  Great quality and the delivery was prompt.  I am very happy with my purchase and I am sure I will enjoy it for years to come..
0 Works as advertised.  Holds skis and holds them well.  No problems.  One note:  It came with locks already.  Maybe that was in the description, maybe not.  But I bought additional locks when I didn't need to.  Oh well.  Great product.
0 Excellent product, simly picture quality is great, excellent sound, quality and excellent finish. I highly recommend it, like all SONY products.   I like: the internet connection is very fast, firmware updates are welcome. very friendly in general management of bluray, the connection with my SONY BRAVIA TV is excellent. video and sound quality is AMAZING.   Dislike: it would have been good to have connection to the network and view videos from various sources such as youtube etc. No wireless connection. It would have been good that can play videos of any type: AVI, MPEG, QuickTime, TP, etc.. To view photos only supports that are recorded on CD or DVD, it hurts not to use flash drive or SD card for viewing photos.     Greetings from Cabimas Venezuela    ESPAÑOL:    Excelente producto, la calidad de imagen es simlpemente grandiosa, el sonido excelente, calidad y acabado excelente. Lo recomiendo altamente,como todos los productos de SONY.  Me gusta: la conexion a internet es muy rapida, las actualizaciones del firmware son bienvenidas. muy amigable en el manejo general del equipo, la conexion con mi TV SONY BRAVIA es excelente. calidad de video y sonido es SORPRENDENTE.  Lo que no me gusta: hubiera sido bueno que tuviera conexion a la red y poder ver videos de distintas fuentes tales como youtube etc. No tiene conexion wireless. Hubiese sido bueno que pudiera reproducir videos de cualquier tipo: AVI, MPEG, QUICKTIME, TP, etc. Para ver fotos solo admite que esten grabadas en cd o dvd, lastima que no use pendrive ni SD para ver fotos.    Saludos Cabimas Venezuela
0 I was immediately drawn into this story.  Marco and Alyssa were so lovable.  I love the authors writing style I'll be back for more.
0 I had the IPhone 5 for two years, it was my first IPhone and I loved it, I had a Android (G2) it was good but it was not fast as my IPhone. This new IPhone is great it's very fast and multifunctional I noticed the Andriod phones sometimes lag and some games also freeze and stop working, but my IPhone works perfect never freezes and it also takes great crystal clear photos. If your debating on a phone and never had a iPhone you should try it out don't just listen to the comments because most of them are android vs IPhone reviews listen to those who actually had the phone and not complain and hate! Anyways thanks Apple!!
0 Listening to Chuck Loeb's latest (Silhoutte - 2013), there was one standard called "My One and Only Love" sung by his daughter Lizzy.  I didn't know what to expect and almost skipped the track.  What a mistake that would have been!  I was immediately struck by the maturity of her voice and her nuanced and confident vocal styling.  A quick search turned up this album, and I can't stop playing it.  Her originality and simple but elegant themes remind me of Norah Jones.  Her subtle inflections tell the story more than the lyrics.  It seems that every phrase stirs the soul because she puts hers into it.  This is definitely one to watch.  Can't recommend it enough.
0 this is an awesome game I love it the hints could be better though. but overall it is pretty interesting and it gets your mind going
0 So far so good.
0 Was easy to install. Met expectations in every way. Unavailable at retail stores in my area. Price also was reasonable.
0 I got this pack and also received a free 12v impact driver from Bosch.  The offer isn't going on anymore, but I'd buy these even if it wasn't.  Excellent quality, and strong motors.  Hold one of these up to a DeWalt version...
0 In my desire to eat healthier and cook healthier for my family, one of the changes I decided to make for everyone's benefit is to cut back on salt/sodium, which we've been pretty heavy-handed with at times. There are so many foods/condiments we do eat that already have salt in them, I decided to try this No Salt Substitute in some of my cooking/baking, as well as with meals to use at the table. So far, my family and I have enjoyed our food as we always have, and we did not note a funny flavor (just a slightly different flavor) or any strange aftertaste (which frankly, I expected we might prior to use).Sprinkling it on (baked) french fries is just okay, but I do like that it has a similar consistency (granules) as salt. The fries are better with it than without it, but I think once we have been using this for a while longer, we will all get more adjusted to it. So far, we have used it on fries, chicken and vegetables. Even if everyone opts to use a little regular salt to sprinkle their foods, if I choose to replace this No Salt for the salt I would have normally used for cooking/baking, we will still be healthier for at least replacing some of our regular salt with No Salt. It does not taste just like salt, but it is more palatable than I thought it would be. I feel I made a good choice in this No Salt, and recommend it.WHY I RECOMMEND THIS:No sodiumGranules are similar to saltNo odd aftertasteSlightly different flavor, but okayCan't tell difference in foods when using while cooking/baking
0 This is probably the best Lightning wire I have seen or had.I purchased one from a different maker and while it worked fast and very well, it broke off in my iPhone.  I had to get a pair of needle nose pliers to remove the little nib part that was left in the phone when it broke.This one is a lot beefier and there is no doubt it will hold up better than most all others.
0 While these fit the Diaper Genie fine, they don't work nearly as well for me as the original refills.  When you dispose of a dirty diaper, an enormous amount of refill is used.  It's almost comical when you empty the diaper pail how ridiculous the excess amount of plastic wrap that exists.  I used two of the four in this pack to confirm that it's not just one defective one - and I made sure the rest of my family used it to double check I wasn't doing something stupid when disposing of a diaper.  Within one day of using the original refills, we're back to sanity.  I'm certainly staying with the originals over this and I'd suggest you do, too.
0 IT works fine and I use it once in a while.  It is easy to use and was easy to load
0 works as expected
0 Excellant picture, had not planned on getting a new TV yet and was looking at the same one in the 50" size and saw I could buy the 58" size for about the same price so order it. The sound is a lot better than what I expected after reading other reports. Really glad I got it. I highly recommend this TV.
0 Entirely predictable story line with characters that no one could possibly like. The paparazzi in the book is entirely over-obsessed with his Nikon cameras. I wonder if this is a result of some kind of product placement incentive provided by Nikon? It doesn't even add anything to the storyline.I had high hopes for this South Florida-based novel, but sadly it did not deliver.
0 I purchased this product based on the reputation of Colorforms in the past (even from my childhood), and based on the fact that it was being to two little girls who love to dress up their dolls, etc.  Most of the individual dressing pieces did not "peel off" very well on the initial trial, and as such, would not stick to the cardboard dolls very well-if they initially came off that way, they were basically ruined for the game. It was so bad that after playing the game three times, the girls threw the game out because their were so few playing pieces left to dress up the dolls with.  And yes, an adult DID help them initially peel off the pieces, so that was not the issue.  This is certainly not a product I would recommend to anyone, and I was very disappointed in the Colorforms line that they would put out something of such poor quality.
0 Liked these a lot! Just like the picture showed and mine came in all the shapes shown. They are pretty thin straws, as you always knew them as a kid!
0 I loved the spotlight series, butI actually want to five 4 1/2 stars not 5 and il tell you why. I was intrigued all the way through the whole series,I think JS Taylor, for this book you put in the correct amount of everything it seemed nearly perfect. NEARLY.. my only complaint - it would have been awesome to be able to read James POV. Instead of hearing about his demons in a second context, it would have been great to see both their views regarding his demons and exactly how he felt with the lipstick stalker. I love reading from other people's POV, I believe it adds so much more depth to a story, I hope more writers adapt this more in the future. So for this i give 4 1/2 stars.
0 My daughter lost her original Periwinkle in an unfortunate accident years ago. She was so happy when I surprised her with a new one, she cried.
0 She may seem abrasive but from the show and now this book, you can see she is a sweetheart and a great mom. I can't even imagine how hard it must be to rebound from such a heartbreak but she only thinks about her children and is now even more beautiful and stronger than ever. Sorry if this sounds like brown nosing but I really think she is a hilarious and strong woman.  Team B fo sho!
0 You probably remember the Cabin Fever tapes from back when you were a kid.  After all, where can you find a more wholesome piece of Americana than in the Depression-era antics of Spanky and company?  Now that you're grown, you probably want to introduce your kids to Our Gang the same way that your parents introduced them to you, as a part of their socialization as equally wholesome, proud citizens.  There's only one problem, I suspect: kids today have no tolerance for "antiquated" black and white cinema.  And really, who can blame them?  Color, the de facto standard to which they were raised, lends life, vibrancy and realism to anything that it glazes.    Thanks to this DVD, you can now bridge that generation gap by watching this newly colorized version of the Little Rascals' greatest shorts (even on the kids' Playstation if need be!).  The drab, depressing black and white of '30s film suddenly comes to life in a full rainbow.  And, should you succeed in making your kids into new fans, you'll always have the option of graduating them to the thoughtfully included black and white versions of the colorized material.  From what I can tell, there's simply no other DVD that allows you the same flexibility.    Hardcore fans of Our Gang should take note of this disc's special features, which include clips of the gang's twenty year reunion and a hilarious skit where they encounter peer jokesters Laurel and Hardy.
0 Great for an AR. Lightweight and definitely as promised. If you're looking for a close quarters optic... look no further. Sure, you can spend 500+ dollars on an EOTech or Aimpoint but realistically need 5 million hours of battery life?
0 Its a statement piece, which we purchased because we love the show.  This is not a daily wear item.  The quality is medium grade and I figure too much wearing and things will break.  Otherwise, about what we expected.
0 This mystery was well written and i would love to read the authors other books.I do not want to reveal too much. just read!
0 We bought this umbrella for the beach and it was perfect.  It was a nice windbreaker as the weather was a bit chilly.  It was very easy to set up and easy to carry.  I would highly recommend this umbrella.
0 Excellent phone case, it fits the Moto E perfectly. All of the ports are available, and the buttons like up correctly. The built-in stand is a bonus and works well. I just accidentally dropped my phone down a flight of cement stairs, as in over the edge of a switchback style staircase, and it fell a full flight before falling to the ground. By the time I reached the bottom of the stairs, the phone was in perfect condition. There was no damage to the body of the phone, and no scratches on the screen. Also, the phone itself still works perfectly as well!  I'm confident that without this case on my phone, I would have been picking up pieces instead of one piece, and I would also be buying a new phone. Thank you for an excellent product!
0 have not been able to find this product in the usual places.  it works great, so I ordered it! :)
0 Excellent way to go
0 This film recounts the life of Jayne Mansfield and her transformation  from a blooming Dallas high schooler to a platinum blonde bombshell who rose to prominence in the Hollywood of the 1950s. Starring Loni Anderson as Jayne and Arnold Schwartzenegger as her one time husband and true love, Mickey Hargitay, a former Mr. Universe and bodybuilder turned business man, the film is mildly entertaining. Her story unfolds through his eyes.Hers is the sad story of an intelligent, beautiful  women who initially chose to be viewed as a dumb blonde sex object in order to jump start her career as a film star,  but who would later want to be given the opportunity to be considered as a serious actress. In her heyday in the 1950s, Ms. Mansfield was the toast of the town with fans up the wazoo.Unfortunately, that was to be somewhat short-lived. Jayne Mansfield was never able to get over her stereotypic portrayal of a bimbo, so Hollywood never gave her serious consideration as an actress. In the battle of the dumb blondes, Ms. Mansfield ran a distant second to Marilyn Monroe. This relegation to the back of the pack would always stick in Ms. Mansfield's craw.By the time the 1960s arrived, she, instead, courted cheap publicity, drank too much, and ended up a faded, buxom has been, as well as a divorcee with three children to whom she was a devoted mother. She was now a relic from a bygone time, as tastes changed with the advent of The Beatles and a new, exciting pop culture was emerging. With Marilyn Monroe already having met her maker, Ms. Mansfield's death from a tragic car accident, at thirty six, was to herald the end of an era.Loni Anderson does an excellent job in the starring role, imbuing the role with enough intelligence, as well as pathos, to be compelling, though somewhat predictable . Surprisingly enough, Arnold Schwartzenegger does a credible job as Mickey Hargitay, painting a sympathetic portrait of Jayne's much beleaguered, one time husband and father to her two boys. Ray Butenika, as Ms. Mansfield's long time agent, Bob, gives a good performance. All in all, the film has an excellent cast that does its best with the somewhat mediocre script and is, at least, worth a rental.I actually remember seeing Jayne Mansfield, when I was a young girl. In those days, theatres in Manhattan, such as the RKO, would often times showcase films in which the star of the film would make a guest appearance. The theatre would literally role out the red carpet and oftentimes a band, as well as a host of majorettes (of which I was one), twirling batons in unison, would greet the star as she stepped out of her limousine, larger than life. The star would also to be met by a throng of cheering fans outside the theatre. Then, she would be whisked away to the theatre, where she would go on stage and say a few words, only to disappear as quickly as she had arrived.  This practice has now been consigned to the darkest recesses of the memories of those who participated in these theatrical welcome wagons.one time husband and father to her two boys.
